# Coding Challenge #4 (Build Your Own Docker)

## Overview

This repo is my solution to John Crickett's [Coding Challenge #4 - Build Your Own Docker](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-docker/).

## Steps

- [x] Step 0: Project setup and download version of Alpine Linux
- [ ] Step 1: Program should run arbitrary commands (e.g. `ccrun run <command> <args>`)
- [ ] Step 2: Give the container its own hostname
- [ ] Step 3: Isolate processes running inside the container from the host filesystem
- [ ] Step 4: Isolate the processes within your container from the host processes
- [ ] Step 5: Run the container rootless
- [ ] Step 6: Limit the resources the container has available to it
- [ ] Step 7: Pull an image from Docker Hub and unpack it
- [ ] Step 8: Run a container from an image pulled from Docker Hub
